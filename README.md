# snet-dapp

This Dapp allows you to browse the list of services from the SingularityNET Registry and call them.
The beta dapp is under active development and will see several changes in the upcoming weeks

## How to call a Service

1. Navigate to the SingularityNET beta [dapp](http://beta.singularitynet.io/)
2. Sign up / Login to the DApp account
3. Every service has a free trial, so you can invoke the service without any payment
4. If free trial has expired, you need to use your AGIX tokens to make the call using Metamask (this is on the mainnet)
5. Authorize and Transfer tokens to the Multi party escrow in the Accounts page
6. Follow the service execution steps on the service details page
7. The result from the operation is displayed in the result tab

## Development instructions

* Install [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/)
* `npm install` to get dependencies
* `npm run start` to serve the application locally and watch source files for modifications

## UI for Services

Currently the UI needed by a service to capture inputs and render the output must be provided by the service developer as a PR. It must be provided in the form of a React component. 
This approach will change in the future as we support a generic mechanism to declaratively describe a service's API. See [this](https://github.com/singnet/custom-ui-research) for more details

## Sandbox mode for Services

    git clone git@github.com:singnet/snet-dapp.git
    cd snet-dapp
    npm install
    cp .env.sandbox .env

1. Update `.env` file to reflect the actual values for each environment variable.

    1. `REACT_APP_SANDBOX_SERVICE_ENDPOINT`

        The endpoint of the service running locally. `snetd` defaults to `http://localhost:8088`.

    2. `REACT_APP_SANDBOX_ORG_ID` & `REACT_APP_SANDBOX_SERVICE_ID` 

        The `org_id` to which the service belongs and the `service_id` of the service. The values set for these variables will be used for registering the custom ui.
    
    3. `REACT_APP_WEB3_PROVIDER`

        The infura endpoint to be used for the Web3 connection.

2. Start the AI service locally along with the snet daemon. Make sure the blockchain is disabled in the daemon configuration. 
3. Building the custom ui
    1. Generate `js` stubs from `.proto` files

        For the custom ui to talk to the services on SingularityNET platform via the DApp, we are using [gRPC-web](https://github.com/improbable-eng/grpc-web) by improbable-eng. Apart from the steps mentioned at the official [documentation](https://github.com/improbable-eng/grpc-web/blob/master/client/grpc-web/docs/code-generation.md) to generate `js stubs` from `.proto` definitions, you also need to provide the `namespace_prefix` flag to the generator. Here is an example which illustrates the usage

        ```
        protoc \
        --plugin=protoc-gen-ts=./node_modules/.bin/protoc-gen-ts \
        --js_out=import_style=commonjs,binary,namespace_prefix=<uniq_name_space>:. \
        --ts_out=service=true:. \
        example_service.proto
        ```

        <uniq_name_space> should be a combination of `package_name` + `org_id` + `service_id`.
For the following [proto file](https://github.com/singnet/example-service/blob/master/service/service_spec/example_service.proto) with `org_id=snet` and `service_id=example-service` the namespace_prefix would be `example_service_snet_example_service`. <br />
        PS: All the `-` should be replaced by `_`.
    2. You need build the custom UI following the steps

        Create a new directory named after the `org-id` to which this service belongs inside `src/assets/thirdPartyServices`. It could be possible that the directory already exists, in which case you can use it instead of creating a new one.

        Create a new directory named after the `service-id` under the newly created directory in the above step

        e.g. for a service with org-id: snet and service-id: example-service you will have to do the following assuming you are at the root of the `snet-dapp`

            cd src/assets/thirdPartyServices
            mkdir snet
            cd snet
            mkdir example_service
            cd example_service

        Put the all the resources used by the custom ui  under this directory including the `js stubs`.

4. Register the custom ui

    Add an entry for the new service in `src/assets/thirdPartyServices/index.js` if it does not already exist. Add the following line towards the end of the file. Make sure to replace `orgId`, `serviceId` and `CustomUIComponent` accordingly. 

        thirdPartyCustomUIComponents.addCustomUIComponent(orgId, serviceId, CustomUIComponent);

5. Assuming that the snet daemon is running on port `8088`, running the bellow commands should bring up the DApp in sandbox mode for local development.

        npm run sandbox

5. Click the button `Run for Free` to see the developing UI for your AI Service.
